Users should see a list of the available maps
As I user I want to see all the available maps because I want to quickly select a map that matches my interests, and create  new map, add or delete points in an existing map. For the same cities.
As I user I want to remember where I went.  
As I user I want to make my maps confidental.
As I user I want to categorize my maps.

I want to create a mp of indian restaurants. This map shold be edited by the new resturants I visit and like. And if I don't like tat place anymore I should be able delete it. I want to share maps with my friends. Or I may want to keep it secret. I might want to use the current location or mark it on the map.
